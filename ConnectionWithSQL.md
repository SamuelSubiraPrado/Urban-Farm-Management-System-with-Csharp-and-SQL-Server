Troubleshooting:

We used a local server for this project due to its scope. If you encounter any issues, check the connection string and make sure your SQL Server settings match the connection string. You can also modify the connection string if needed, but ensure that the variables in the new script remain the same.

If you are experiencing issues with the SQL Server connection but just want to see how the system works, there is a demonstration video available on my LinkedIn, posted on 01/07/2025 (or 07/01/2025, following the Brazilian date format).
